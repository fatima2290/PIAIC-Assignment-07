## Code Explanation

At first, according to the requirements in question name of a person is taken as input then 3 numbers are taken as input and typecasted to integer type.
After printing a personalized message the numbers are stored in a list.
Then 2 lists are created in order t store tuples.
A function is created to check wether the number is even or odd.
Then a function is created to calculate the square of each number.
At the end of each function result is stored in the empty lists created.
After that a loop is created to apply both functions on each number in list.
2 more loops are created to display the values stored in list. In order to comply with the requirement specified in the question's sample output format.
After that the sum of all 3 numbers taken as input from user is calculated and the result is stored in a new variable.
And a personalized message is printed displaying the sum.
Then to check wether the sum is a prime number or not logic is created.
At first a list is created to store all the factors of the number.
then an if condition check wether there are only 2 factors or more in the list.
If there are only 2 values in the list then it is a prime number.
Otherwise it is a composite number.
At the end a message according to the either satisfied condition is printed.
